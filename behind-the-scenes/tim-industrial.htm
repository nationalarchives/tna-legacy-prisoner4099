		<h3>Instructions and regulations for certified industrial schools</h3>

		<p>Industrial Schools and Reformatory Schools were set up in the mid nineteenth century.  Reformers believed that by keeping children away from crime they would stand a better chance in the future.</p>

		<p>The purpose of Industrial Schools was to help vulnerable children before they committed a crime.  One of the aims was to introduce children to activities that could help them in their working lives.  Life in Reformatory Schools was harsher, as children were sent there having committed an offence.</p>
