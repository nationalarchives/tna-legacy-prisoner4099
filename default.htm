		<div>

		<p>In 1872 William Towers was 12 years old. He was caught stealing two rabbits &mdash; possibly for food for his family. As punishment William was sent to Wandsworth prison. He was Prisoner 4099.</p>

		<p>A group of students created and performed a play inspired by William's experience using real historical documents. The actual records still exist and are kept in The National Archives. This website tells the story.</p>

		</div>

	<div id="panel-william">

		<p id="panel-top">William was probably just like many other Victorian working-class boys. He wore shabby, dark old clothes, held together with buttons and stitches.</p>

		<p>To be sent to prison at such a young age must have been simply terrifying. Try to imagine how you would feel to be away from your family and in a strange place full of people you do not know.</p>

		<p id="panel-base">He looks unhappy and may have been biting back the tears. The untidy, handwritten sign, held around his neck with string, shows his prison number; 4099.</p>
